# iOCO-Cascade_Classifier
This is a script that helps complete the parameter configuration and training of OpenCV cascade classifiers with once click, simplifying program invocation and configuration.

## Quick Start
1. Unzip the 'opencv_world320' and 'opencv_world320d' in the folder cause they are too big to upload without zipping
2. Place positive and negative samples in the 'pos' and 'neg' folders
3. Modify the parameters in the 'options.py'
4. Run the 'train.py'
5. Check the result by 'test.py' in folder 'xml'
